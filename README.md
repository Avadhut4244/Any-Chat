# AnyChat

We are developing a web-based AnyChat application that includes login and signup functionality, utilizing a MySQL database on an XAMPP server to securely store user login information.

The AnyChat application is a college project focused on creating a real-time communication platform accessible through web browsers. It leverages modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience.
